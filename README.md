Theese are my solutions to some of the problems found in advent of code 2024
=I did not realize the event was ongoing until day 7, also primarily due to
 time constraints not al solutions will be posted.
=I expect most of them to be written in C, and they shall be simple if somewhat
 unoptimised, especially concerning memory (the most fun part for me shall be
 the design of simple solutions).
=Feel free to use the code if/as you wish
